# fidj-node Product Context

## Why This Project Exists
fidj-node was created to address the common challenges developers face when building applications that need to interact with remote services. Authentication, connection management, and session handling are complex tasks that often require significant development effort. This library aims to simplify these tasks by providing a set of reusable components that handle these concerns in a secure and reliable way.

## Problems It Solves

### Authentication Complexity
- Simplifies the process of authenticating clients with remote services
- Manages tokens (access, ID, refresh) securely
- Handles user roles and permissions

### Connection Management
- Provides a consistent interface for managing connections to remote services
- Handles connection errors and retries
- Manages connection state and lifecycle

### Session Handling
- Maintains user session state
- Handles session expiration and renewal
- Provides secure session storage

### Common Utility Functions
- Offers Base64 encoding/decoding
- Provides storage operations for persistent data
- Includes XOR operations for basic encryption/decryption

## How It Works

### Connection Module
The connection module handles client authentication and connection management. It provides:
- Client authentication with token-based mechanisms
- User management with roles and permissions
- Connection lifecycle management
- Error handling and retry logic

### SDK Module
The SDK module provides a framework for interacting with remote services. It includes:
- Service interfaces for consistent API access
- Error handling specific to service interactions
- Logging capabilities for debugging and monitoring

### Session Module
The session module manages user sessions. It offers:
- Session creation and management
- State persistence across application restarts
- Secure session storage

### Tools Module
The tools module provides utility functions for common operations:
- Base64 encoding and decoding
- Storage operations for persistent data
- XOR operations for basic encryption/decryption

## User Experience Goals
- Provide a simple and intuitive API for developers
- Minimize boilerplate code required for common tasks
- Ensure type safety through TypeScript definitions
- Maintain backward compatibility across minor versions
- Provide comprehensive documentation and examples
