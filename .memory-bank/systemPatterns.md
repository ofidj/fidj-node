# fidj-node System Patterns

## System Architecture

fidj-node follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns. The library is organized into several modules, each responsible for a specific aspect of functionality:

```
fidj-node
├── connection (Client authentication and connection management)
├── sdk (Service interaction)
├── session (Session handling)
└── tools (Utility functions)
```

Each module is designed to be used independently or in combination with other modules, providing flexibility for different use cases.

## Key Technical Decisions

### TypeScript for Type Safety
The library is built with TypeScript to provide strong typing and better developer experience. This ensures that errors are caught at compile time rather than runtime, improving code quality and reducing bugs.

### Module-Based Architecture
The decision to use a module-based architecture allows for:
- Clear separation of concerns
- Independent development and testing of modules
- Flexibility in how the library is used

### Token-Based Authentication
The library uses token-based authentication (access, ID, refresh tokens) for secure client authentication, which is an industry standard for web applications and APIs.

### Interface-Driven Design
The library uses interfaces to define contracts between components, making it easier to understand, test, and extend the codebase.

## Design Patterns

### Factory Pattern
Used in the connection module to create client instances with appropriate configuration.

### Singleton Pattern
Applied to certain services to ensure a single instance is used throughout the application.

### Observer Pattern
Implemented for event handling in the connection module to notify subscribers of connection state changes.

### Strategy Pattern
Used in the SDK module to allow different service implementations to be swapped out without changing the client code.

### Repository Pattern
Applied in the storage functionality to abstract the data access layer.

## Component Relationships

### Connection and Session
The connection module provides authentication mechanisms that the session module uses to establish and maintain user sessions.

### SDK and Connection
The SDK module uses the connection module to authenticate requests to remote services.

### Tools and Other Modules
The tools module provides utility functions used by all other modules, such as Base64 encoding/decoding and storage operations.

## Error Handling Strategy

The library implements a consistent error handling strategy across all modules:
- Custom error types for different categories of errors
- Detailed error messages for debugging
- Error propagation to the client application
- Retry mechanisms for transient errors

## Testing Approach

The library follows a comprehensive testing approach:
- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for module interactions
- Test coverage monitoring
- Continuous integration to ensure code quality
