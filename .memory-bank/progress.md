## What's Left to Build

### Testing Enhancements
- Increase test coverage for edge cases
- Add more integration tests
- Implement end-to-end testing scenarios

### Documentation Improvements
- Add more detailed API documentation
- Create more comprehensive usage examples
- Develop tutorials for common use cases

### Feature Enhancements
- Support for additional authentication methods
- Enhanced error reporting
- Performance optimizations
- Browser compatibility for key components

### Tooling
- Automated dependency updates

- Documentation generation from code comments

## Current Status

The library is currently at version 15.1.13 and is stable for production use. Recent improvements include:

- Added needsRefresh() and isConnected() methods
- Enhanced error handling for endpoints
- Improved synchronization in sendOnEndpoint
- Code linting and formatting improvements
- Updated dependencies to latest versions
- Additional unit tests for improved code quality

The library is actively maintained and continues to be enhanced with new features and improvements.

## Known Issues

### Minor Issues
- Some edge cases in error handling may not be fully covered
- Documentation could be more comprehensive in certain areas
- Test coverage could be improved for some modules

### Potential Improvements
- The XOR implementation is basic and not suitable for high-security applications
- Browser compatibility requires additional work
- Some utility functions could be optimized for performance

## Release Readiness

The current version (15.1.13) has been released with the following completed:

- All critical bugs have been fixed
- Unit tests are passing
- Documentation has been updated
- Memory Bank is being maintained
- Release notes have been updated

The library is ready for use in production environments.
