## What's Left to Build

### Testing Enhancements
- Increase test coverage for edge cases
- Add more integration tests
- Implement end-to-end testing scenarios

### Documentation Improvements
- Add more detailed API documentation
- Create more comprehensive usage examples
- Develop tutorials for common use cases

### Feature Enhancements
- Support for additional authentication methods
- Enhanced error reporting
- Performance optimizations
- Browser compatibility for key components

### Tooling
- Automated dependency updates
- More comprehensive linting rules
- Documentation generation from code comments

## Current Status

The library is currently at version 15.1.10 and is stable for production use. Recent improvements include:

- Fixed auto createdUser functionality
- Fixed refreshConnection functionality
- Added endpoint error handling
- Improved synchronization in sendOnEndpoint
- Added unit tests for improved code quality
- Updated dependencies to latest versions

The library is ready for release with these improvements.

## Known Issues

### Minor Issues
- Some edge cases in error handling may not be fully covered
- Documentation could be more comprehensive in certain areas
- Test coverage could be improved for some modules

### Potential Improvements
- The XOR implementation is basic and not suitable for high-security applications
- Browser compatibility requires additional work
- Some utility functions could be optimized for performance

## Release Readiness

The current version (15.1.10) is ready for release with the following completed:

- All critical bugs have been fixed
- Unit tests are passing
- Documentation has been updated
- Memory Bank has been established
- Release notes have been updated

The npm publish process can proceed as planned through the CI/CD pipeline.
